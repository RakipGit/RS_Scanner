## RS Scanner – Python Port Automation Scanner

A fast,multi-threaded Python port scanning tool designed to identify open ports and associated services on a target domain.Built for speed simplicity and clean terminal visualization.

---

## Project Summary
I built RS Scanner as a personal networking and cybersecurity utility to automate the process of scanning open ports on a target system.The scanner resolves domain names,fetches geolocation data and performs highly parallel threaded port scanning with a clean structured output using Rich CLI.

This project helped me:
- Strengthening my Python skills and applying them to real-world cybersecurity tasks
- Socket programming
- Multi-threading in Python
- Building interactive terminal CLI
